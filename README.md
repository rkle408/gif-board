# gif-board

## An application to cure your boredom, and that may also expand your vocabulary, utilizing random word generator and GIPHY APIs.

## APIs Utilized:
#### 1) "Random Word API." API Ninjas. <https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomword> Date accessed: Tuesday, September 13, 2022.
The random word API generator allows our users to find (mostly) entertaining gifs, even if they have no idea where to start. Not only are fun words generated, but unfamiliar words as well, allowing an educational component to our application.

#### 2)  "GIPHY API." GIPHY Developers. <https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide> Date accessed: Tuesday, September 13, 2022.
Our team utilized the Search endpont GIPHY API to then take the aforementioned randomly generated word to render a gif animation associated with the same word or similar tags.
