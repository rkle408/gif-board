# gif-board

## An application to cure your boredom, and that may also expand your vocabulary, utilizing random word generator, GIPHY, and dictionary APIs.
Our team's main goal in developing this application is two-fold: quell boredom, while also possibly providing an educational component.

Our application gives you the options of either having an API give you a randomly generated word, or you can input your own text, and that will automatically autopopulate into the GIPHY generator, displaying a fun gif on the page! If you are unfamiliar with the randomly generated word, we also attached a dictionary API so you can easily look it up! 

As our first project collaborating with others, we learned there are numerous aspects that are different from working alone. First, we learned the importance of constant communication, constant saves and commits, and constantly ensuring we all had updated GitHub main branch repos in our individual local machines. We learned that working together helps us all learn, as we all have different viewpoints, different ways of understanding, and different ways to explain that may be easier for another person to understand.

## APIs Utilized:
#### 1) "Random Word API." API Ninjas. <https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomword> . Date accessed: Tuesday, September 13, 2022.
The random word API generator allows our users to find (mostly) entertaining gifs, even if they have no idea where to start. Not only are fun words generated, but unfamiliar words as well.

#### 2)  "GIPHY API." GIPHY Developers. <https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide> . Date accessed: Tuesday, September 13, 2022.
Our team utilized the Search endpont GIPHY API to then take the aforementioned randomly generated word to render a gif animation associated with the same word or similar tags.

#### 3) "Dictionary API." API Ninjas. <https://api-ninjas.com/api/dictionary> . Date accessed: Thursday, September 15, 2022.
We realized that because the Random Word API also generates educational words, we decided to add a dictionary API to look up possible unknown words to also make it educational.
