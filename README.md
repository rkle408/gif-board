# gif-board

## An application to cure your boredom, and that may also expand your vocabulary, utilizing a random word generator API and a GIPHY API.
Our team's main goal in developing this application is two-fold: quell boredom, while also possibly providing an educational component.

Our application gives you the options of either having an API give you a randomly generated word through the press of a button, or you can input your own text, and that will automatically autopopulate into the GIPHY generator, displaying a fun gif on the page!

As our first project collaborating with others, we learned there are numerous aspects that are different from working alone. First, we learned the importance of constant communication, constant saves and commits, and constantly ensuring we all had updated GitHub main branch repos in our individual local machines. Second, and seemingly most importantly, we learned that working together helps us all learn, as we all have different viewpoints, different ways of understanding, and different ways to explain that may be easier for another person to understand.

One of our greatest challenges in this project was overcoming our <i>fear</i> of losing all of our hardwork on GitHub. Thankfully, through our teamwork and communication, this fear never came to fruition. Throughout the project, we would run into minor challenges, such as buttons breaking or words not populating, but again, through teamwork, we were able to navigate through those issues to continue to improve and add to our code.

For future development, we have adding a dictionary API on our brainstorm list, especially since we encountered random words that none of the four of us were familiar with. Another minor issue that we had was that some of the randomly generated words did not have associated gifs, and we therefore will try to resolve this issue utilizng a meaningful photo (to us), that will hopefully bring a smile to your face (or haunt your nightmares). Another lofty idea we have is having our application integrated into a phone's messages application so that you can randomly start funny conversations with friends even if you have nothing to talk about!

## Technologies Utilized:
#### 1) "Random Word API." API Ninjas. <https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomword>. Date accessed: Tuesday, September 13, 2022.
The random word API generator allows our users to find (mostly) entertaining gifs, even if they have no idea where to start. Not only are fun words generated, but unfamiliar words as well.

#### 2)  "GIPHY API." GIPHY Developers. <https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide>. Date accessed: Tuesday, September 13, 2022.
Our team utilized the Search endpont GIPHY API to then take the aforementioned randomly generated word to render a gif animation associated with the same word or similar tags.

#### 3) Bulma CSS Framework. <https://bulma.io/documentation/>. Date accessed: Tuesday, September 13, 2022.
We utilized Bulma to ensure an esthetically pleasing and simple layout.
